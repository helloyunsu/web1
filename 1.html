  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <strong><u>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</u> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

  HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the primary markup language used to structure content on the web. Every single web page on the internet has at least some HTML markup included in its source code, and most websites are comprised of many HTML or HTM files.
  The language rules that HTML follows describe to a web browser how to display the text that makes up the web page. Without HTML to structure the content on the page, the text would appear formless, without the color, tables, formatting, lists, and headings that make it easier to read.
  Knowing what HTML is, how it came to exist, and how the markup language is constructed shows the amazing versatility of this basic website architecture and how it continues to be a major part of how we view the web.
